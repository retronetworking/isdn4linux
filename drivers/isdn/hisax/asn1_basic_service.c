 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.5  2000/01/20 07:30:09  kai
 * rewrote the ASN.1 parsing stuff. No known problems so far, apart from the
 * following:
 *
 * I don't use buildnumber() anymore to translate the numbers to aliases, because
 * it apparently did never work quite right. If someone knows how to handle
 * buildnumber(), we can go ahead and fix this.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1999/12/31 13:30:01  akool
 * isdnlog-4.00 (Millenium-Edition)
 *  - Oracle support added by Jan Bolt (Jan.Bolt@t-online.de)
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1999/10/30 13:42:36  akool
 * isdnlog-3.60
 *   - many new rates
 *   - compiler warnings resolved
 *   - fixed "Sonderrufnummer" Handling
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/04/26 22:11:54  akool
 * isdnlog Version 3.21
 *
 *  - CVS headers added to the asn* files
 *  - repaired the "4.CI" message directly on CONNECT
 *  - HANGUP message extended (CI's and EH's shown)
 *  - reactivated the OVERLOAD message
 *  - rate-at.dat extended
 *  - fixes from Michael Reinelt
 *
 *
 * Revision 0.1  1999/04/25 20:00.00  akool
